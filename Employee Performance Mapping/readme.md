Building an **employee performance mapping** solution for a data science startup. 

**Map Employes and track their Performance**

- **Analyze Employee Ratings**: Use manager-provided ratings to support HR in mapping overall employee performance effectively.
- **Identify Maximum Salary**: Query the employee database to find the highest salary, which may help benchmark compensation ranges.
- **Validate Job Profiles**: Ensure all job roles align with the organization's profile standards, checking against predefined criteria or job descriptions.
- **Calculate Bonuses**: Estimate bonus amounts based on performance, role, or other business rules to evaluate additional financial liabilities.
- **Forecast Expense Impact**: Assess how bonuses and training costs contribute to the organizationâ€™s overall expenses.
- **Support Training Strategy**: Highlight employees needing development based on performance mapping, guiding HR in planning skill-building programs.
- **Enhance Organizational Performance**: Use insights from this process to support employee growth and streamline resource allocation.


The goal is to design and implement a **relational database** that can store customer data, subscription details, transaction history, and churn status.
